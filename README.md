# Spotwater
Analyzing and plotting data with Python Bokeh

Spotwater.py is the main file name, Funcs is a folder with the extra functions used in the files. PlotTabs contains all the py files for the tabs.

The 'Large data set' is an example of data while the "Master-Sheet" contains the info for which chemical group a compound is in.

To run the program, update line 25 on Spotwater.py. If you put the files in "C:\Program Files\ImAwesomeProgrammer", then just replace "folder_location_goes_here" with "Program Files\ImAwesomeProgrammer". 

This program doesn't require you launch Bokeh server in command prompt. Lines 25 and 26 do that for you. In Anaconda/Spyder, just click run.
